		<h2>Mission</h2>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To satisfy our partners and customers with a unique shopping experience offering quality, variety, price and service, based on the attention and commitment of our employees.</p>
		<h2>Vision</h2>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be an independent, innovative, honest and sustainable cooperative in which customers are able to choose from a wide range of goods at reasonable prices. In other words, to be a model company and a reference in the distribution sector.</p>
		<h2>Goals</h2>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of our grocery is to satisfy the needs of the customers also to give enjoyment while they're buying and to earn income and also to help our workers to earn more.</p>
		
		<h2>Ways and Means</h2>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Puregreen supermarket have experienced independent operators know how to get products into customers’ shopping carts. They study their sales trends and understand what sells well and how much of it to order. They display items just the right way to capture customers’ attention. That ability comes from the five or more years of retail management experience that we require of our candidates, as well as their proven sales and merchandising skills and responsible financial background. Another key attribute of an independent operator is commitment to community involvement — participating in and sponsoring events around the local community is a big part of growing the business.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The independent operators become integral parts of their neighborhoods. Independent operators are leaders in their community and are very active in their stores. They possess exceptional communication skills and an ability not only to hire and train qualified employees, but to engage and inspire their employees to optimally perform at their highest level.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The operators of our most successful locations dedicate themselves to being in their stores, helping staff, engaging with customers, and merchandising for an amazing bargain shopping experience. Having independent operators willing to dedicate whatever time it takes to ensure that the grocery brand shines and customers receive top level service creates an infectious positive culture for their employees and promotes a real team approach to running a store, which is vital in order for a Puregreen market competes with the big grocery store chains.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Becoming an independent operator is not about how much money a prospect has. While an independent operator must meet minimum financial qualifications, our main focus is on identifying candidates that know how to manage and motivate employees and maximize sales at the supermarket store while maintaining the highest level of customer service. We make large capital investments in retail stores, in inventory and in systems and training.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our tremendous faith in skilled independent operators is demonstrated when we hand over a fully stocked retail store and allow the independent operators the freedom to create their own organization and use our brand to grow a business in their local community.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That’s why we look for candidates with these qualities: a responsible financial track record; passion for retail; entrepreneurial motivation to grow their own business; and a willingness to involve themselves in the community. If those ingredients are there, the candidate should succeed in achieving their own financial goals as an independent operator while helping reach our aggressive sales targets.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our independent operators will give them the independence to use their own business acumen and judgment to move our products out the door and turn over their inventory at a rapid pace. Puregreen Supermarket relies on the creativity of its independent operators to do this.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our buyers find great name-brand products from suppliers who find themselves with overruns, surplus inventories, repackaged products and perishable foods. We’ve built strong relationships with many suppliers so that our independent operators can sell great brand-name products at far lower prices than conventional stores. The thing that most sets our buyers apart from our competitors’ buyers is our flexibility, speed, and responsiveness to suppliers</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our customers are very comfortable with the idea of being opportunistic buyers, and we’re taking advantage of other companies’ natural inefficiencies to become a destination for deals.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With our business model, customers may save up to 60% in comparison to a conventional grocery store. We validate our pricing differences with routine price checks on the most commonly purchased items in both discount and conventional grocery stores.</p>
